# AudioBase

This is a web app that displays the statistics of your Spotify songs in one place. 

## Information and Requirements

- This app was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Lots of information about how to run this app can be found in README-create-react-app.md.
- If you are running the app on localhost, once you have downloaded the code, type `npm start` into your console within the project directory in order to start.
- Note that a **Node** version above 14.0.0 and an **npm** version above 5.6 is required on your machine for all of this to work.
- To run this yourself, you also need to go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/), register an app, obtain a client ID and client secret, and register redirect URIs, then update secrets.js with all of your information.

## Notes
- This app is still in progress. In the future, I plan to add graph visualizations, as well as host it permanently somewhere that has yet to be decided.
